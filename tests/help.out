ion 1.0.0-alpha
The fast, safe, modern rust shell. Ion is a commandline shell created to be a faster and easier to use alternative to
the currently available shells. It is not POSIX compliant.

USAGE:
    ion [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [args]...

FLAGS:
    -f, --fake-interactive    Use a fake interactive mode, where errors don't exit the shell
    -h, --help                Prints help information
    -i, --interactive         Force interactive mode
    -l, --login               No-op for backwards compatability for systems that expect a "login-shell"
    -n, --no-execute          Do not execute any commands, perform only syntax checking
    -x                        Print commands before execution
    -v, --version             Print the version, platform and revision of Ion then exit

OPTIONS:
    -c <command>             Evaluate given commands instead of reading from the commandline
    -o <key-bindings>        Shortcut layout. Valid options: "vi", "emacs"

ARGS:
    <args>...    Script arguments (@args). If the -c option is not specified, the first parameter is taken as a
                 filename to execute
