NAME
    exists - check whether items exist

SYNOPSIS
    exists [EXPRESSION]

DESCRIPTION
    Checks whether the given item exists and returns an exit status of 0 if it does, else 1.

OPTIONS
    -a ARRAY
        array var is not empty

    -b BINARY
        binary is in PATH

    -d PATH
        path is a directory
        This is the same as test -d

    -f PATH
        path is a file
        This is the same as test -f

    -s STRING
        string var is not empty

    STRING
        string is not empty
        This is the same as test -n

EXAMPLES
    Test if the file exists:
        exists -f FILE && echo "The FILE exists" || echo "The FILE does not exist"

    Test if some-command exists in the path and is executable:
        exists -b some-command && echo "some-command exists" || echo "some-command does not exist"

    Test if variable exists AND is not empty
        exists -s myVar && echo "myVar exists: $myVar" || echo "myVar does not exist or is empty"
        NOTE: Don't use the '$' sigil, but only the name of the variable to check

    Test if array exists and is not empty
        exists -a myArr && echo "myArr exists: @myArr" || echo "myArr does not exist or is empty"
        NOTE: Don't use the '@' sigil, but only the name of the array to check
