# Examples

These files show examples of Ion scripts with their expected output. These
scripts have been developed on Ubuntu and will be used as a part of the CI
process, which is also currently run on Ubuntu. As such, they will assume that
a basic subset of the utilities available on Ubuntu are available on the host
operating system running these scripts (e.g. `echo`, `cat`).

Each script ends with `.ion`, the expected file extension for Ion scripts. The
expected output will be in a `.out` file of the same name as a the script.
