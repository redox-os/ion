## pushd

```
pushd DIRECTORY
```
Push a directory to the stack.

## random

```
random
random SEED
random START END
random START STEP END
random choice [ITEMS...]
```

RANDOM generates a pseudo-random integer from a uniform distribution. The range (inclusive) is
dependent on the arguments passed. No arguments indicate a range of [0; 32767]. If one argument
is specified, the internal engine will be seeded with the argument for future invocations of
RANDOM and no output will be produced. Two arguments indicate a range of [START; END]. Three
arguments indicate a range of [START; END] with a spacing of STEP between possible outputs.
RANDOM choice will select one random item from the succeeding arguments.

> Due to limitations int the rand crate, seeding is not yet implemented

## set

```
set [ --help ] [-e | +e] [-x | +x] [-o [vi | emacs]] [- | --] [STRING]...
